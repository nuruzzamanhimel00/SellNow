# SellNow – Assessment Project

A **simplified, intentionally imperfect** platform for selling digital products, built for **candidate assessment**.
This project contains **deliberate flaws, bad practices, and security holes** for learning and evaluation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

SellNow is a small marketplace where:

1. Users can register and get a public profile at `/username`
2. Users can upload digital products (image + file)
3. Buyers can browse products, add to cart, and checkout

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

### 2. Database Setup (SQLite by Default)

```bash
sqlite3 database/database.sqlite < database/schema.sql
```

> If you want MySQL, update: `src/Config/Database.php`

### 3. Environment File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
php -S localhost:8001 -t public
```

### 5. Open in Browser

```
http://localhost:8001
```

### 6. Test Login

* Email: `hello@app.com`
* Password: `12345678`

## 🔄 Recent Fixes & Enhancements

### 1. Authentication & Security Fixes

**Problems Fixed**

* Login failed after registration
* Missing `.env`
* No CSRF protection
* Plain-text passwords
* Error messages not showing

**Solutions**

* Added `.env` from example
* Added CSRF tokens to forms
* Switched to `password_hash()` and `password_verify()`
* Refactored controllers with Request/Response
* Fixed error and success message display

**Files Updated**

* `AuthController.php`
* `login.html.twig`
* `register.html.twig`
* `.env`

---

### 2. .gitignore Added

Prevents committing:

* vendor/
* .env
* uploads/
* logs/
* IDE files

---

### 3. CSRF Fix on Product Add Form

**Problem**: POST `/products/add` returned 403

**Cause**: Missing CSRF token in form

**Fix**:

```twig
<form ...>
  {{ csrf_field()|raw }}
  ...
</form>
```

**Flow**

1. Token generated and stored in session
2. Token added to form
3. Middleware validates token
4. Request allowed

## 🔒 Security Enhancements

| Area        | Before        | After                  |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Password    | Plain text    | Bcrypt                 |
| SQL         | Raw queries   | Prepared statements    |
| CSRF        | None          | Token-based            |
| File Upload | No validation | MIME + extension check |
| XSS         | Raw output    | Escaped output         |

---

## ⚖️ Trade-offs

| Choice        | Cost           | Benefit            |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Custom Router | Fewer features | Full control       |
| Simple DI     | Manual wiring  | Easy to understand |
| Repository    | More code      | Testable           |
| Session Cart  | Lost on expire | Simple             |
| Mock Payment  | Not real       | Shows architecture |
| No ORM        | More SQL       | No magic           |
